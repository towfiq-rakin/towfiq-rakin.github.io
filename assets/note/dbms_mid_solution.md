#### Question 1
###### a. Present a comparative overview among the different levels of abstraction of a database management system. <span style="float: right; ">06 </span>

**Ans:** 
1. **Physical level:** 
	   The lowest level of abstraction describes how the data are actually stored. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.
2. **Logical level:**
	   Describes data stored in database, and the relationships among the data. The conceptual schema describes the design of a database at the conceptual level. Conceptual level is also known as logical level.
	   **type** instructor = **record**
		   ID : string;
		   name : string;
		   dept_name : string;
		   salary : integer;
		**end**;
3. **View level:**
	   Application programs hide details of data types. Views can also hide information (such as an employeeâ€™s salary) for security purposes.

###### b. What is **Data Model**? Write down the name of two existing data model.<span style="float: right; ">04 </span>
**Ans:** Underlying the structure of a database is the data model: a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints. A data model provides a way to describe the design of a database at the physical, logical, and view levels.
Among four  different categories, two models are:
1. **Relational Model:** The relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and relationships among those data.
2. **Entity-Relationship Model:** The entity-relationship (E-R) data model uses a collection of basic objects to design a database.

#### Question 2
###### a. Find the **Primary Key** for all the tables with brief justification of the reason to choose the attribute in the primary key: <span style="float: right; ">06 </span>
*order* (order_id, product_id, quantity, unit, unit_price, discount, bill)
*warehouse_stock* (warehouse_id, product_id, quantity, last_updated)
*order_details*(customer_id, product_id, warehouse_location, order_date, quantity, shipping status)
**Ans:**
**1. `order`**
	**Primary Key:** _(order_id, product_id)_  
	**Justification:**  Each order may include multiple products. Thus, the combination of _order_id_ and _product_id_ uniquely identifies every product entry within an order.

**2. `warehouse_stock`**
	**Primary Key:** _(warehouse_id, product_id)_  
	**Justification:**  A product can be stored in multiple warehouses. The pair _(warehouse_id, product_id)_ uniquely identifies each product stored in a specific warehouse.

 **3. `order_details`**
	**Primary Key:** _(customer_id, product_id, order_date)_  
	**Justification:**  A customer can order the same product on different dates. Hence, _(customer_id, product_id, order_date)_ uniquely represents each order transaction.

###### b. Write the query in SQL to create the `order`relation.<span style="float: right; ">04 </span>
**Ans:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    unit VARCHAR(10),
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    discount DECIMAL(5,2),
    bill DECIMAL(10,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);
```

#### Question 3
###### a. Consider the following relational schema for an online grocery shop database.<span style="float: right; ">02+03+03 </span>
*customer* (customer_id, customer_name, city, age)
*product* (product_id, product_name, price, category)
*order* (order_id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, order_date)
*stock* (product_id, warehouse, quantity_available)

Write **relational algebra expressions** for each of the queries:
1. Retrieve the customers who have ordered products in the "Electronics" category.
2. List the product IDs that have been ordered by customers from "Dhaka" but are not available in the warehouse "Central Warehouse".
3. Retrieve the names of warehouses that stock only products from the "Clothing" category.

**Ans:** 
1. $$\Pi_{customer\_{id},\space customer\_{name}}( \sigma_{category=\text{"Electronics"}}(order\bowtie product \bowtie customer))$$
2. $$
\begin{align*}
\Big(\Pi_{\text{product\_{id}}}\big(\sigma_{\text{city="Dhaka"}}(\text{customer} \;\bowtie\; \text{order})\big)\Big)- \\ \Big(\Pi_{product\_id}\big(\sigma_{\text{warehouse}='Central\ Warehouse'}\space \land\space_{\text{quantity\_availabe=0}}(\text{stock})\big)\Big)
\end{align*}$$
3. $$\pi_{warehouse}\Big(\sigma_{\text{category} = 'Clothing'}(\text{stock} \;\bowtie\; \text{product})\Big)$$
###### b. What is Data Manipulation Language?<span style="float: right; ">02 </span>
**Ans:**  A **data-manipulation language (DML)** is a language that enables users to access or manipulate data as organized by the appropriate data model. It is a subset of SQL used to **retrieve, insert, update, and delete data** in a database. It focuses on **manipulating data within existing tables**, not defining the schema (which is done by DDL).

#### Question 4
Consider the following relational schema for an online grocery shop database.
*customer* (customer_id, customer_name, city, age)
*product* (product_id, product_name, price, category)
*order* (order_id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, order_date)
*stock* (product_id, warehouse, quantity_available)
###### a. Write **query in SQL** for each of the following queries: <span style="float: right; ">03+04+03 </span>
1. Show the customer IDs in the descending order who have ordered products in the "Electronics" category.
2. Find the names of products that have been ordered by customers from the city "Dhaka" and display the total quantity ordered for each of those products.
3. List the Product ID and Product Name of products that are currently out of stock in the "Central Warehouse".

**Ans:**
1. 
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM `order` 
NATURAL JOIN product
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
ORDER BY customer_id DESC;
```

2. 
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product_name, quantity
FROM `order`
NATURAL JOIN product
NATURAL JOIN customer
WHERE city = 'DHAKA';
```

3. 
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product_id, product_name
FROM stock
NATURAL JOIN product
WHERE quantity_available = 0 and warehouse = "Central Warehouse";
```
